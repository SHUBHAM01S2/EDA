# 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my repository where I’ve explored **5 different datasets** using detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. Each notebook dives deep into the data, uncovers hidden patterns, and draws meaningful insights using Python.

---

## 📌 What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of examining datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps in:

- Understanding data structure
- Detecting anomalies and missing values
- Discovering patterns and relationships
- Making assumptions for modeling

EDA is a crucial step in the **data science lifecycle** before building models.

## 🛠️ Steps of EDA

### 1. **Understanding the Dataset**
- Overview of the dataset
- Data source and context
- Business objective / Problem statement
- Data types and column descriptions

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Fixing data types
- Outlier detection and treatment

### 3. **Univariate Analysis**
- Distribution of individual variables
- Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.)
- Frequency plots, histograms, and boxplots

### 4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**
- Correlation between two or more variables
- Scatter plots, pair plots
- Grouped bar charts, heatmaps
- Crosstab and pivot tables

### 5. **Feature Engineering**
- Creating new features
- Encoding categorical variables
- Binning, transformation, or scaling

### 6. **Visualization**
- Using libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**
- Interactive dashboards (optional)
- Visual storytelling
